# Sample Box

## Scenario

You managed to get access to the network where a development server is running. Your goal is to fully compromise the machine and get root access.

## Installation

Clone this repo to any fresh Debian server install, then run `linux-setup.sh` as root. It will convert the fresh install into a vulnerable box to practice!
