The server admin granted me root access using the SSH public key in my home.
Just in case I forget the password, I made this super secure recovery procedure:

The file dmesg.txt is hiding my password in a fragmented form as follows:
- Each fragment is stored in a line starting with "CCF:"
- A total of 5 fragments exist
- Get each fragment and reverse their order (example frag3,frag2,frag1 becomes frag1,frag2,frag3)
- Replace '{' with 'V', ')' with 'Y' and '*' with 'Z'
- base64 decode the string -> get password

Hint: Use grep, cut, tac, tr, base64 commands
