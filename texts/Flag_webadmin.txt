The server admin granted me some extra privileges using an alternative user. I can su into it with a password.
Just in case I forget the password, I made this super secure recovery procedure:

A file somewhere can be used to reconstruct the password.
- Each fragment is stored in a line strating with "CCF:"
- A total of 5 fragments exist
- Get each fragment and reverse their order (example frag3,frag2,frag1 becomes frag1,frag2,frag3)
- Replace '{' with 'V', ')' with 'Y' and '*' with 'Z'
- base64 decode the string -> get password

Flag: Bad password practices backfires! - 20 points
